# nano-settings-python
my personal setup for an almost productive nano

Copy the .nanorc to ~/.nanorc and the python.nanorc to either /usr/share/nano/ or /usr/local/share/nano/, depending on your installation. 
Check the path in .nanorc and fix if necessary. Before copying the python.nanorc, you should make a backup of the original.
